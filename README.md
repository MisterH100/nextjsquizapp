Transparency is key! We want to share that all quizzes featured in our app were carefully curated through outsourcing, particularly utilizing resources from [Mentimeter](https://www.mentimeter.com/blog/audience-energizers/55-free-trivia-and-fun-quiz-question-templates).

Moreover, we owe the aesthetic appeal of our app to the incredible icons sourced from [svgrepo](https://www.svgrepo.com/). These icons contribute to the visual richness and user-friendly interface of our platform.
